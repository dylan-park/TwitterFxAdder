# TwitterFxAdder
A super basic and bare bones java based script that detects changes in your clipboard, and if it detects a Twitter status link converts it to an fxTwitter variant, because I was sick and tired of needing to remember to add it myself.

The built jar file in Releases is intended to be run on startup, or whenever needed. It sleeps when not in use, and has no external java packages.
